As an Undergraduate Engineering student at Carleton University, I am honoured to call Canada my new home because of the acceptance of diversity I see in my academic, professional, and social environments.

I've had the opportunity to build and improve applications with talented managers, mentors, coworkers, and friends who have been raised in places all over the world and bring their own perspectives, experience, and knowledge to the table. Diversity makes us stronger and ready to better serve to the global community that exists today.

With ‚ù§,
Irusha
