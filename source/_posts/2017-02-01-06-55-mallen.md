I grew up in step with the web, and saw what was a weird niche I had inhabited grow into the backbone of the world's communication.
It feels more than a little heartbreaking to see all the negativity and hate seeping through it these days.

As an LGBT person I can be fearful about current events, but I know it's even worse for others. My heart
goes out to anyone who is living in fear or who can't see their family or loved ones due to someone else's hate. To those who have *lost* loved ones because of it.

We have eachothers backs here. 
Let's stay strong through our diversity, and never succumb to the dark side.
